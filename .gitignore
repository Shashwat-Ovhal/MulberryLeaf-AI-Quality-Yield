# Exception: Keep example/small data if needed, but usually data is ignored. 
# For this submission, if data is small (~100 images), we might want to keep it?
# The prompt said "Clean the repository... docs remain". 
# Usually trained models are ignored.
# I will ignore models/ but maybe the user wants to keep data?
# I'll stick to the specific request: "Ignore trained model files (*.h5, *.pkl)"
