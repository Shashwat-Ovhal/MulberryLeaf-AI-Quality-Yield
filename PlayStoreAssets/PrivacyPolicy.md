## 1. Information We Collect

### 1.1 Camera and Images
The App requests access to your device's camera to capture images of mulberry leaves. These images are used solely for the purpose of:
- Analyzing leaf quality and detecting diseases.
- Providing real-time visual feedback via the camera overlay.

### 1.2 User Input Data
We collect environmental data that you manually enter, such as:

This data is used to predict silkworm cocoon yield.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

- **On-Device Processing:** Where possible, image analysis is performed locally on your device using LiteRT (TensorFlow Lite) technology.
